## Name
Synthesis of Redstone Circuits

## Description
TODO: Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Visuals
TODO: Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
TODO
Racket + DrRacket in einem: https://download.racket-lang.org/
in ordner gehen bzw file finden dann:
raco pkg install rosette
raco pkg install while-loop

## Usage
TODO: Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Roadmap
For future work, more redstone-related objects can be implemented.
This increases the likelihood of the synthesis finding a satisfiable assignment.
When expanding the algorithm to handle three-dimensional circuits, many new possibilities arise.
Implementing more than two time steps further increases the capabilities.

## Authors and acknowledgment
TODO: Maximilian: Idee und Betreung ...
Martina Seidl als Prof

## License
TODO: Max fragen bzw Ã¼berlegen wenn selbst auf github tun

## Project status
TODO: If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
