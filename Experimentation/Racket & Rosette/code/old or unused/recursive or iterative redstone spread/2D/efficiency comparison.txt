n: size of square, so 4 would mean 4 times 4
s (start): 0 --> (0 0); m (middle) --> (n/2 n/2)

with print output for every cell
n  | s | BFS | DFS 
-------------------
 7 | 0 | <1s | 130s
 7 | m | <1s |  50s
17 | 0 | 15s | did not try
17 | m | 33s | did not try

without prints both can handle way more
